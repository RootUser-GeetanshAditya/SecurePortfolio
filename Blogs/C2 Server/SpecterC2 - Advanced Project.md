# **SpecterC2 – Advanced Modular C2 Framework**

## **Red Team Project Development Plan**

### **Summary of project**

SpecterC2 is a sophisticated Command and Control (C2) framework, which is designed to be stealthy, modular, and provide offense security functions. It provides a cross-platform support of implants, adaptive and encrypted communication protocols, and extensible plugin environment that focused on post-exploitation workrack.

---

### **Objectives**

Build a cross-platform C2 infrastructure that focuses on stealth.

- Program modules on Windows, Linux and macOS.
- Bundle secure user-configured transportation layers (e.g. QUIC, HTTPS, DNS-over-HTTPS).
- Deploy advanced evasion and anti-analysis measures (e.g. AMSI bypass, anti-debugging).
- Strong operator interfaces (Command Line Interface and Web- based UI).
- Make it extensible by means of a module-based plugin structure.

### **Core Components**

| Component | Language / Stack | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C2 Server | Go / Python (FastAPI) | Backend services for implant management |
| Operator Interface | React + Tailwind CSS | Web-based UI for operator control |
| Implants ("Ghosts") | C++ / Rust / C# | Cross-platform payloads for target systems |
| Transport Layer | QUIC, HTTPS, DNS-over-HTTPS | Covert and secure communication channels |
| Payload Builder | Python + Web UI | Custom implant generation and configuration |
| Plugin System | Python + Interface API | Post-exploitation module support |
| Security Layer | AES, RSA, TLS | End-to-end encryption and authentication |

### **Phase-Wise Development Plan**

### **Phase 1 – Planning & Requirements**

- Define supported operating systems and implant capabilities.
- Assign team responsibilities (backend, implants, UI, payloads).
- Finalize communication protocols (e.g., QUIC, HTTPS, DNS).
- Select implementation languages and tools.
- Define Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope.

---

### **Phase 2 – Backend Development**

- Develop the core C2 server using FastAPI or Go:
    - Implant registration and beacon handling
    - Task queuing and result collection
    - Implant metadata storage (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
    - Encryption using AES-256 and RSA handshake
    - Operator authentication (JWT or token-based)
    - RESTful and WebSocket interfaces

**Deliverable:** Functional backend capable of managing implants and tasks securely.

---

### **Phase 3 – Implant Development**

- Develop a Windows-based implant in C++:
    - Persistent beaconing mechanism
    - Encrypted communication with C2 server
    - Remote shell command execution
    - In-memory payload execution
- Develop Linux/macOS versions as functional wrappers.
- Implement anti-analysis checks (e.g., anti-debugging, sandbox detection).
- Integrate obfuscation techniques and stager functionality.

**Deliverable:** Functional cross-platform implants with core features.

---

### **Phase 4 – Operator Interface**

- Build a web interface using React:
    - Implant management dashboard
    - Task assignment and result viewing
    - Interactive shell interface
- Develop a CLI tool for scriptable operator tasks.

**Deliverable:** Usable web and CLI interfaces for red team operations.

---

### **Phase 5 – Payload Builder**

- Implement a web and CLI-based payload builder:
    - Support for multiple transport layers
    - Configurable obfuscation and sleep/jitter behavior
    - Support for various loader formats (e.g., LNK, macro, HTA)
    - Output formats including shellcode, executables, and DLLs

**Deliverable:** A configurable payload generation utility.

---

### **Phase 6 – Plugin System & Post-Exploitation Modules**

- Define a plugin interface in Python.
- Develop initial post-exploitation modules:
    - Keylogger
    - Screenshot capture
    - File manager (upload/download)
    - Lateral movement via WMI/SMB

**Deliverable:** A modular plugin system with multiple post-exploitation capabilities.

---

### **Phase 7 – Transport Evasion**

- Implement covert transport techniques:
    - QUIC-based communication
    - DNS tunneling
    - Randomized URI generation
    - Domain fronting or host rotation (time-permitting)

**Deliverable:** Enhanced transport layer with stealth features.

---

### **Phase 8 – Evasion & Stealth Enhancements**

- Integrate advanced evasion features:
    - AMSI bypass (C++ and .NET)
    - ETW patching
    - Anti-debugging and anti-virtualization techniques
    - In-memory PE loader

**Deliverable:** Evasion pack integrated into implant builds.

---

### **Phase 9 – Testing & Operational Security Audit**

- Conduct internal testing using detection tools (e.g., Sysmon, Windows Defender).
- Simulate detection by blue teams and refine payloads.
- Evaluate payloads using AV and sandbox environments.

**Deliverable:** Hardened payloads and improved stealth through feedback loop.

---

### **Phase 10 – Documentation & Release (Week 19)**

- Develop comprehensive documentation:
    - Developer and operator manuals
    - Plugin development guides
    - GitHub README
- Finalize licensing (e.g., GPLv3 or equivalent)

**Deliverable:** Complete documentation and public release preparation.
